# Nodes-in-linked-lists
Linked lists are a type of data structure that is commonly used in computer science and programming. A linked list is a collection of nodes, where each node contains some data and a pointer to the next node in the list. The first node in the list is called the head, and the last node in the list points to null.

Each node in a linked list contains two fields: a data field and a next field. The data field contains the data that the node stores, and the next field contains a pointer to the next node in the list. The next field is usually a null pointer for the last node in the list.

'Nodes' in a linked list can be added or removed at any position in the list, which makes them more flexible than arrays. However, accessing a specific node in a linked list requires traversing the list from the head until the desired node is reached, which can be slow for large lists.

Linked lists can be implemented in various ways, including singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular linked lists. In a singly linked list, each node only has a pointer to the next node in the list. In a doubly linked list, each node has pointers to both the next and previous nodes in the list. In a circular linked list, the last node in the list points to the head of the list, creating a loop.

Linked lists are commonly used in programming for tasks such as implementing stacks, queues, and hash tables. They are also useful for dynamic memory allocation and managing large data structures. However, they have some disadvantages, including slower access times than arrays and higher memory overhead due to the need for storing pointers to the next node.
